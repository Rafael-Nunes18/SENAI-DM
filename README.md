SENAI-DM

This repository was created to share activities and projects developed during my Systems Development course at SENAI.
At the time this README is being written, I‚Äôm currently posting activities from my second semester.

About the Repository

The Systems Development course at SENAI is divided into four areas: Embedded Systems, Front-End, Back-End, and Mobile.
For that reason, the directories are organized accordingly, with each one containing activities related to its respective topic.

Main Projects

Below are some of the most prominent projects in the repository:

.Traffic Light Intersection üö¶
Using an Arduino and some LEDs, I created a traffic light system.

.Pizzeria üçï
